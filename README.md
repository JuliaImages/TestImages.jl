This package provides a convenient Julia interface for loading
[standard named test images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_test_image) and example images for the internal usage in JuliaImages.
This can be used in conjunction with the
[Images](https://github.com/JuliaImages/Images.jl) package.

## Documentation

Full documentation and description of the images available in TestImages.jl can be found [here][doc-url].

## Installation

`TestImages` doesn't support image IO by itself, which means you need to install some backends on your choice, e.g., [ImageMagick.jl](https://github.com/JuliaIO/ImageMagick.jl), [QuartzImageIO](https://github.com/JuliaIO/QuartzImageIO.jl), [OMETIFF.jl](https://github.com/tlnagy/OMETIFF.jl).

## Usage

```julia
using TestImages

img = testimage("cameraman.tif") # fullname
img = testimage("cameraman") # without extension works
img = testimage("cam") # with only partial name also works

img = testimage_dip3e("fig0905") # load figure 9.5: wirebond-mask from the DIP3E textbook
img = testimage_dip3e("wirebond-mask") # same as above

phantom = TestImages.shepp_logan(256) # generate the Shepp-Logan phantom image
```

There is also `testimage_dip3e` that loads image for the DIP3E textbook, "Digital Image Processing,
3rd edition" by Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods. Permission is required from the owner of a
Â© image if the image is used for other than personal educational or research purposes. See
[copyright file](https://www.imageprocessingplace.com/DIP-3E/dip3e_copyrights.htm).

Images will be automatically downloaded into artifact folders when you load the image for the first time.

## Compatibility

For users with Julia < v1.3.0, TestImages v0.6.z will still be under maintenance. However, newly added test images will not be available in those versions.

## Contributing

A detailed guide on contributing to TestImages.jl can be found in the documentation mentioned above.

as well as other phantoms like focus charts,
and can compute sinograms and spectra of such phantoms.
